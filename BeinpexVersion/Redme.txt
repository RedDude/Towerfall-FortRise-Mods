Troubleshooting
The game crashes before it even loads! (Windows only)
If the game crashes before loading, or you see an error in the console that says 

An attempt was made to load an assembly from a network location which would have caused the assembly to be sandboxed in previous 
versions of the .NET Framework.

on Windows, head into the BepInEx/core and BepInEx/plugins folders, open the properties for each DLL,
and hit the unblock checkbox at the bottom.
